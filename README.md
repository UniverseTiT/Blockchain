Thie blockchain durian tracking system is a digital solution that uses blockchain technology to track the journey of durians from farm to consumer. Each durian is assigned a unique digital ID, which records key information such as the farm where it was grown, the harvesting process, transportation details, and quality checks. This data is securely stored on the blockchain, making it transparent, tamper-proof, and easily accessible by consumers, distributors, and regulators.
